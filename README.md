# Telco Customer Churn

This project is focused on analyzing customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal is to understand why customers are leaving the company and to identify potential actions that can be taken to reduce churn.

# Data

The data used in this project is a customer churn dataset from a telecommunications company. The dataset includes information on customer demographics, services used, and whether or not the customer has churned.

# Methodology

The project uses a combination of descriptive statistics, data visualization, and machine learning techniques to analyze the data. The following steps were taken:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential relationships
* Data visualization to further explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns
* Modeling using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
* Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score
* Feature importance analysis

# Results

The EDA revealed that there are several factors that are associated with customer churn, including contract type, internet service, and monthly charges. The visualization showed that customers with month-to-month contracts and fiber optic internet service have a higher churn rate compared to customers with other contract types and internet services.

The machine learning models were able to accurately predict customer churn with an accuracy of around 80%. The feature importance analysis indicates that the top three important features that affect customer churn are contract type, tenure, and monthly charges.

# Conclusion

The findings of this analysis can be used to develop strategies to retain customers and reduce churn. The telecommunications company can target customers with high monthly charges, short tenure, month-to-month contracts, fiber
